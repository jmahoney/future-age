# FUTURE AGE IS A FEED READER

Future Age is an RSS reader designed for [me](https://interative.co.nz) to use.

It is inspired by the intensions behind and years of using [Adam Mathes's original neko reader](https://github.com/jmahoney/neko) and, lately,  Robin Sloan's essay _[An app can be a home-cooked meal](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/)_.

Future Age is named after the Wilco song _In A Future Age_.

If you'd like to run a copy of futureage your self you'll need familiarity with Ruby On Rails. Ping me if you'd like help.
